ycmd: a code-completion & comprehension server
==============================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Valloric/ycmd.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Valloric/ycmd)

ycmd is a server that provides APIs for code-completion and other
code-comprehension use-cases like semantic GoTo commands (and others). For
certain filetypes, ycmd can also provide diagnostic errors and warnings.

ycmd was originally part of [YouCompleteMe][ycm]'s codebase, but has been split
out into a separate project so that it can be used in editors other than Vim.

The best way to learn how to interact with ycmd is by reading through the
[`example_client.py`][example-client] file.

API notes
---------

- All strings going into and out of the server are UTF-8 encoded.
- All line and column numbers are 1-based, not 0-based.
- All file paths are full, absolute paths.
- All requests to the server _must_ include an [HMAC][] in the `x-ycm-hmac` HTTP
  header. The HMAC is computed from the shared secret passed to the server on
  startup and the request/response body. The digest algorithm is SHA-256. The
  server will also include the HMAC in its responses; you _must_ verify it
  before using the response. See [`example_client.py`][example-client] to see how it's done.

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

ycmd's HTTP+JSON interface follows [SemVer][]. While ycmd has seen extensive use
over the last several months as part of YCM, the version number is below 1.0
because some parts of the API _might_ change slightly as people discover
possible problems integrating ycmd with other editors. In other words, the
current API might unintentionally be Vim-specific. We don't want that.

Note that ycmd's internal API's (i.e. anything other than HTTP+JSON) are **NOT**
covered by SemVer and _will_ randomly change underneath you. **DON'T** interact
with the Python/C++/etc code directly!

FAQ
---

### Is HMAC auth for requests/responses really necessary?

Without the HMAC auth, it's possible for a malicious website to impersonate the
user. Don't forget that evil.com can send requests to servers listening on
localhost if the user visits evil.com in a browser.

**This is not a theoretical concern**; a working proof-of-concept remote code
execution exploit [was created][exploit] for ycmd running on localhost. The HMAC
auth was added to block this attack vector.
